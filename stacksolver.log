*** Failed to arrive at a workable build plan.

Solver could not resolve package dependencies.
You can try the following:
    - Update external packages with 'stack update' and try again.
    - Tweak stack.yaml and try again
        - Remove any unnecessary packages.
        - Add any missing remote packages.
        - Add extra dependencies to guide solver.
        - Adjust resolver.
